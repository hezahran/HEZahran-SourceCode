					<p class="lead">Hi, my name is <strong>Hashem Zahran</strong>, a passionate freelance Web &amp; Mobile <strong>UX/UI Developer</strong> based in the beautiful Mediterranean city of Alexandria, Egypt.</p><!-- /.lead -->
					<p>Holding a Degree in Sociology and a Diploma in Human-Computer Interaction I initially started my career as a <strong>Web UI Developer</strong> for a firm in Alexandria that specialized in Cutting Edge Web Technologies. Always a visionary entrepreneur at heart with several involvements since my teen years like founding a computer hardware company at the age of eighteen, I have since co-founded &amp; operated multiple design agencies &amp; worked as a <strong>Front-End Developer</strong> for several tech companies as well.</p>
					<p>In late 2010 I Joined <strong>eSpace Technologies</strong> and lead their design team, I managed to work closely with some of <strong>TechStars</strong> graduates like <strong>Marginize</strong>. In 2011 I joined the <strong>Startup Weekend</strong> Global Facilitators Team and started to evangelize the startup ecosystem in my own town and since then I have been known as the <em>Godfather of Alexandrian Startups</em>. I have involved in and initiated several Startup Communities in the city including Startup Meet-up Alex, Design Mondays, and Alexandria Startup Club with a mission to foster and empower entrepreneurship Eco-system within Alexandria.</p>
					<p>I co-founded a few tech startups including <strong>Tabshora</strong>, <strong>WalletIO</strong>, &amp; <strong>VoicedHQ</strong>. I also co-directed the chapter of The <strong>Founder Institute</strong> in Egypt to help empowering young entrepreneurs along with my main firm <strong>Cloud7Labs</strong> which provided a 6-week pre-incubator program focused on the first phase of launching a web or mobile startup.</p>
					<p>I believe that entrepreneurship is what will take the Egyptian economy to the next level and it is exactly what fits the Egyptian post-revolution economy. Startups should get all the support needed to grow and expand by the ecosystem community leaders &amp; of course the government and that what will boost Egypt's economy.</p>
					<p>Finally, I create wire-frames, prototypes, mock-ups, &amp; layouts using my favorite design tool Illustrator and my favorite editor Sublime Text. I love developing for WordPress with clear code and creative results. I also help brands in discovering new ways to interact with their customers via latest trends in social media marketing.</p>
