It’s been a long time since I’ve blogged anything online… Recently, I’ve been extremely busy getting out of my bubble and was looking for a new adventure, and finally managed to create my new next big thing…

Starting today, I’ll try to get back to blog some useful information and lessons learned from my new adventure. Will try to share thoughts, experiences, mistakes, and contribution to initiatives that are currently running in Alexandria… So let me know what you want to know about and will be waiting your feedback on my future posts…

On a side note, I've totally created my [new website][hezahran] during repetitive power cuts which lasts for more than 14 hours a day... Thankfully I managed to survive during this power outage and made something useful.
