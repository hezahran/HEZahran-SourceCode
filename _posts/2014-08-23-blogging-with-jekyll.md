I've been trying new technologies every now and then. I've been a big fan of [RoR][ror] since few years now but never tried to create an application with it... This time I tried to create and host my own personal website on [GitHub Pages][ghpages] and make a good use of my no longer used [github account][ghaccount]...

While creating a [GitHub Pages][ghpages] I get introduced to [Jekyll][jekyll] a simple blog-aware static sites generator that is so simple and easy to use hence it generate pages written by [Markdown][markdown], [Textile][textile], [Liquid][liquid], or even simple HTML & CSS...

I've started by installing the gem on my laptop and created first blog post using [Markdown][markdown] syntax and instantly pushed the generated site to my Github repo... So far so cool, today I'm going to play around with the looks and feel of this blog by adopting my own theme into it... If I came across anything unusual, I'll sure be blogging about it...

Let me know your thoughts about it and get in touch with me on [Twitter][twitter]...
