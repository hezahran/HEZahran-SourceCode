Since I've got introduced to [Jekyll][jekyll] and started [blogging with it][blogging], I've been playing around with it to get the most out of it... There are so much that you can do with this little yet powerful generator... That's why I decided to move my full site not only the blog to be using Jekyll...

First step for me is to move my code of my own website to Jekyll... Migration was extremely easy and yes it saved me lots of time afterwards specially on the pagination of both blogs and portfolio... Although what I hate about the output is that both HTML & CSS output are not tidy enough as those generated by [Hammer for Mac][hammer] or [CodeKit][codekit] still it has lots of potentials on it... Maybe when I dig more into plugins I find something useful minify the output or make it looks more tidy...
