Well since I'm a freelancer now, I decided to create a dedicated website for a new brand sole Proprietorship company to showcase my services and past work I've made during the past years plus being a playground for new technologies I learn through out the years.

I went directly to [FatWallet][fatwallet] & searched for [GoDaddy][godaddy] coupons for .com domains and after getting my coupon I went to [NameCheckr][namecheckr] to see what name could I come up with that is available on all social media accounts as well as a .com domain. and the winner was [HECreek][hecreek]... 

Instantly I visualized how to logo will look like and how I will be shaping this development studio into a really freelance business. I'll post here daily my [HECreek][hecreek] updates along with tutorials on how I'll develop and host the new studio website... It should be fun I guess...
